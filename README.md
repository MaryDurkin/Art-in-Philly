* Download the repository and run either of dist/index.html or src/index.html on a local server.
* Head over to the gh-pages version of the repository, [here](http://marydurkin.github.io/Art-in-Philly/)

(If you would like to rebuild the dist files, download the repository and run the grunt command in the terminal).

The app uses the a map provided by Google and customized using the [google maps styles wizard](http://googlemaps.github.io/js-samples/styledmaps/wizard/index.html). Other content provided by [FourSquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/).

The CSS for the navigation menu was adapted from code written by [Austin Wulf](https://www.sitepoint.com/pure-css-off-screen-navigation-menu/)

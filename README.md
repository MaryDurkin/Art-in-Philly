### Art in Philly

There are src and dist folders containing source and production code. The dist folder can be found at the gh-pages version of the repository, [here](http://marydurkin.github.io/Art-in-Philly/)

Hi Heidi!

I have the basic functionality completed (I haven't started the styling yet, so it looks pretty ugly - my apologies). I do have a couple of bugs that I can't figure out.
1. Occasionally, on refresh, I get the following error message
Uncaught InvalidValueError: initMap is not a function
2. The drop down menu filter options need to be clicked twice before they work (on mac Chrome) It seems to work fine on firefox nd safari. I did try the forums for this but the mentor couldn't recreate the issue (I think he was using Chrome on windows). [here is the forum link](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/using-data-bind-click-with-select-tab/169375)

I'm also having a problem with getting my gruntfile to correctly minify the mhtl - if there is time I would appreciate help with that too.

Suggestions or work-arounds for the above appreciated.


(If you would like to rebuild the dist files, download the repository and run the grunt command in the terminal).



## Thank You!

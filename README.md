## Mary Walsh  - FEND - Neighborhood Map Project

### Art in Philly

There are src and dist folders containing source and production code. The dist folder can be found at the gh-pages version of the repository, [here](http://marydurkin.github.io/Art-in-Philly/) Actually they aren't there yet! but will be when I am a little further along in the project

(If you would like to rebuild the dist files, download the repository and run the grunt command in the terminal).
  - the dist files haven't been built yet...... I'll get there


## Thank You!
